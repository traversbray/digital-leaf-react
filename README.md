# Digital Leaf -- Built with React + Vite

A WIP react based website built to replace a pre-existing wordpress theme built in Sage 9 + Larvel. 

## WP-Rest API driven content.

The content within this site is purely pulled from wordpress wp-json and JS fetch. You can find the api fetch functions within the api directory as well as a loader.js file for easy exporting and importing loaders into your Router Provider.

The config file for the API endpoints lives here: `config > apiConfig.js`
